        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p>
            This is my own personal website that I use for posting blogs as well as trying out new 
            stuff and playing around with my knowledge in programming and web developing. 
            It uses Vuejs, a PHP backend and a MySQL Database. Feel free to 
            visit the Music page, read my blogs or leave a comment. More content coming soon!
